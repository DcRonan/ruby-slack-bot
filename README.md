## Description
> This is my final project for completing the `Ruby` module. In doing so, I have created a `Slack Bot`.

![gif](./assets/slack-recording.gif)

In this Slack Bot, I have created it so you can interact, receive messages and information for what you desire. I have created an app that provides you with a broad range of information on an english football league, the `Premier League` ‚öΩ

## Built With üõ†
```
- Ruby 2.6.3
- Slack
- VS Code

```
